Hey wardens, please note that for this contest, **gas optimizations are out of scope.** The Rolla team will not be awarding prize funds for gas-specific submissions.

Hi

How did the protocol change since the audit you had in July?


[03/17/2022 5:02 AM] quantizations#3869
Hi @Pedroais - here's a list of changes that we made since the audits - some cosmetic, other functional and some bugfixes that weren't identified in the audits:

- Migrated from solidity `0.7.6` to `0.8.12`
- Parameterised `strikeAssetDecimals` -> previously this was hardcoded as 6 as we were going to use USDC on polygon. now it's generalised.
- Restricted `strikeAsset` for options in the `OptionsFactory`
- Changes to various events - `SpreadMinted` has more parameters. `QuantConfig` was missing events so we added those. Added event to `ChainlinkFixedTimeOracleManager`
- Timelock changed - no delay when setting protocol values for the first time now
- Some gas optimizations in the `Controller` - before we were passing structs in memory multiple times, but we put them in the stack now and pass in calldata
- Removed `strings` library and use enums for actions instead
- Fixed a bug in the `AssetsRegistry`. Previously had a try catch block which would always revert. Introduced `addAssetWithOptionalERC20Methods` method.
- Removed `quantityTickSize` from `AssetsRegistry` which is no longer relevant. Was a parameter we were going to use for another codebase.
- Fixed a bug in meta transactions signature recovery. We were not checking the v value was 27 or 28 when verifying signatures.
- Removed `OptionsRegistry` and `ReferralRegistry` periphery contracts and related interfaces and libraries.
- Removed `tokenSupplies` from collateral token
- Gas optimizations for for loops in various places - use unchecked math to increment and cache length in loop declaration
- Introduced abstract `QTokenStringUtils` which `QToken` extends from. Same methods from before just migrated to a separate contract which is inherited from
- Made `TimelockController` abstract
- Added a lot of natspec that was missing and parameter/return value names in interfaces
- Paramaterized the `URI` field of the `CollateralToken` which is now taken as a constructor arg instead of hardcoded

@üê∫wardens Important update:  since Github has had some unexpected downtime today, which is affecting this contest's submission form, we're extending the submission deadline by 24 hours. 

(We're in the process of updating our website, etc. but you should see that change reflected everywhere soon.)

Hi, what is the purpose of `protocolUints256` and `protocolBooleans`?


[03/24/2022 8:01 AM] 0xca11.eth#9656
Hey! Just like `protocolAddresses`, they're supposed to stored configured global variables. Only the addresses mapping is used in the Quant Protocol itself, while the uint256 and boolean mappings are currently used by other contracts that interact with and are built on top of the Quant Protocol.


[03/24/2022 8:13 AM] 0xdjango
Very nice, thanks. Do you have a super high-level example of how these other contracts use these variables?


[03/24/2022 9:23 AM] 0xca11.eth#9656
No problem!
One example would be:
```
uint256 someProtocolFee = IQuantConfig(quantConfig).protocolUints256(
            keccak256("someProtocolFee")
);```
